Vodafone UA have VoLTE and/or VoWiFi provisioned?
  For 16.02.2025, already is. They started provisioning about month or so ago.

Are Vodafone UA have a written phone number in phone settings at new SIM-cards?
  I hasn't got a new SIM-card, so this is unknown. But for old SIM (mine), my Poco C65 are showing phone number.

Are Vodafone UA have soem features like ViLTE (Video calls over LTE)?
  Yes. Because my Poco C65 doesn't support ViLTE, I cannot test this out. But friend accidentally call me with ViLTE and I got a unanswered call. So, at least, I didn't miss a call attempt
