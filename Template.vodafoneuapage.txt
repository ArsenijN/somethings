Vodafone UA have VoLTE and/or VoWiFi provisioned?
  For 16.02.2025, already is. They started provisioning about month or so ago.

Are Vodafone UA have a written phone number in phone settings at new SIM-cards?
  Unknown. I hasn't got a new SIM-card, so this is unknown. But for old SIM (mine), my Poco C65 are showing phone number.
