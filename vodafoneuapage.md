Do Vodafone UA have VoLTE and/or VoWiFi provisioned?
  At 16.02.2025, they already does it. They started provisioning about a month or so ago.

Are Vodafone UA have a written phone number in phone settings at new SIM-cards?
  I hasn't got a new SIM-card, so this is unknown. But for old SIM cards that was manufactured more than 5 years ago (mine), my Poco C65 shows SIM carrier phone number.

Are Vodafone UA have some features like ViLTE (Video calls over LTE)?
  Yes. Because my Poco C65 doesn't support ViLTE, I can't test this out. But my friend accidentally called me via ViLTE and I got a unanswered call. So, at least, I didn't missed a call attempt.
